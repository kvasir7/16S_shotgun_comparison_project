###analyzing group differences in ACE diversity with Kruskal Wallis test follwoed by Dunn's posthoc tests as Gaussian distribution not assumptions not met (small data sets)

library(readODS)
library(FSA)

mydata <- read_ods("alpha_diversity_ACE_combined.ods")
head(mydata

set.seed(0)
kruskal.test(ACE ~ Reference, data = mydata)
dunnTest(ACE ~ Reference, data = mydata, method = "bonferroni")

### can also use bh, etc.
### e.g. dunnTest(ACE ~ Reference, data = mydata, method = "bh")
### the same tests were also applied to combined Shannon's diversity data generated in Qiita
